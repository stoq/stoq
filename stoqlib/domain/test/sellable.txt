Doctest for domain/sellable.txt

Imports that will be used in this doctest:

    >>> from stoqlib.database.runtime import new_transaction
    >>> from stoqlib.domain.product import Product
    >>> from stoqlib.domain.sellable import Sellable
    >>> from stoqlib.domain.sellable import BaseSellableInfo
    >>> from stoqlib.domain.sellable import SellableCategory

Create a new transaction

    >>> trans = new_transaction()

BaseSellableInfo
================

.. TODO:
..     def get_commission(self):
..     def get_description(self):

    >>> info = BaseSellableInfo(connection=trans, description="Sellable")

Commission is initially set to 0:

    >>> info.get_commission()
    Decimal('0.00')

    >>> info.get_description()
    u'Sellable'

SellableCategory
================

.. TODO:
..     def get_commission(self):
..     def get_description(self):
..     def get_commission(self):
..     def get_markup(self):
..     def get_full_description(self):


Sellable
========

    >>> sellable = Sellable(base_sellable_info=info,
    ...                     barcode='1138', connection=trans)

    >>> sellable
    <Sellable ...>

    >>> product = Product(sellable=sellable, connection=trans)

Properties: Markup, Price and Commission
========================================

Markup is initially set to 0, since we haven't defined price or cost:

    >>> sellable.markup
    Decimal('0')

Let's say that the initial price is 20 and the cost to 10

    >>> sellable.price = 20
    >>> sellable.cost = 10

Then we will have a markup of 100%:

    >>> sellable.markup
    Decimal('100')

If we modify markup directly, the price will be updated:

    >>> sellable.markup = 200
    >>> sellable.price
    <currency ...30...>

But the cost will stay the same:

    >>> sellable.cost
    <currency ...10...>

The default commission is 0

    >>> sellable.commission
    Decimal('0.00')

It can be modified:

    >>> sellable.commission = 10

    >>> sellable.commission
    Decimal('10.00')

Querying sellable status
========================

.. TODO:
..     def is_sold(self):
..     def sell(self):
..     def cancel(self):

A newly created sellable is in the status sold, because there are no available
items to sell:

    >>> sellable.status == Sellable.STATUS_SOLD
    True

Since there's no stock, then it cannot be sold:

    >>> sellable.can_be_sold()
    False

At some point we get stocks, then we make it possible to sell it:

    >>> sellable.can_sell()

And the it's possible to sell it:

    >>> sellable.can_be_sold()
    True

Accessors
=========

.. TODO
..     def get_code_str(self):
..     def get_short_description(self):
..     def get_suggested_markup(self):
..     def get_unit_description(self):
..     def get_description(self):

Class methods:
=============

.. TODO:
..     def check_barcode_exists(cls, barcode):

This will return a list of available sellables:

    >>> sellable.status == Sellable.STATUS_AVAILABLE
    True
    
    >>> sellable in Sellable.get_available_sellables(trans)
    True

Selling the sellable, removes it from the list of available sellables:

    >>> sellable.sell()
    >>> sellable in Sellable.get_available_sellables(trans)
    False

Also, we can get a list of available sellable by a list of categories:

    >>> category = SellableCategory(description='Battery', connection=trans)
    >>> sellable.category = category
    >>> sellable.can_sell()
    >>> sellable in Sellable.get_unblocked_by_categories(trans, [category])
    True

Unblocked means available or sold:

    >>> sellable in Sellable.get_unblocked_sellables(trans)
    True

    >> sellable.sell()
    >>> sellable in Sellable.get_unblocked_sellables(trans)
    True

Blocking the sellable removes from the return value:
    
    >>> sellable.status = Sellable.STATUS_BLOCKED
    >>> sellable in Sellable.get_unblocked_sellables(trans)
    False
    
Sold means, are the ones which are in the state sold:

    >>> Sellable.get_sold_sellables(trans).count()
    5L

We can query using a specific barcode:

    >>> sellable.barcode == '1138'
    True
    
    >>> Sellable.get_availables_by_barcode(trans, '1138')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    BarcodeDoesNotExists: The sellable with barcode '1138' doesn't exists or is not available to be sold

    >>> sellable.cancel()

    >>> sellable == Sellable.get_availables_by_barcode(trans, '1138')
    True

And for sold sellables using a specific barcode:

    >>> sellable == Sellable.get_availables_and_sold_by_barcode(trans, '1138')
    True

    >>> sellable.status = Sellable.STATUS_BLOCKED

    >>> Sellable.get_availables_and_sold_by_barcode(trans, '1138')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    BarcodeDoesNotExists: The sellable with barcode '1138' doesn't exists or is not available to be sold
